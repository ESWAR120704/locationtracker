**Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Document**  

**1. Introduction**  

**1.1 Purpose**  
The purpose of this document is to define the software requirements for the Mobile Number Location Tracker project. This system enables users to retrieve the geographical location and service provider details of a given phone number and visualize the location on an interactive map.

**1.2 Document Conventions**  
This document follows IEEE standards for Software Requirements Specification (SRS).

**1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions**  
This document is intended for developers, project managers, testers, and stakeholders interested in understanding the project requirements.

**1.4 Product Scope**  
The Mobile Number Location Tracker is a Python-based application that fetches location details of a given phone number, identifies the service provider, and displays the location on a map. It leverages third-party APIs such as OpenCage Geocode and OpenStreetMap via the Folium library to generate a visual representation of the location.

**2. Overall Description**  

**2.1 Product Perspective**  
This project is an independent application that utilizes external libraries and APIs to process mobile number data.

**2.2 Product Functions**  
- Parse and validate the phone number using the `phonenumbers` library.
- Identify the geographical location of the phone number.
- Retrieve the service provider information.
- Convert the location to latitude and longitude using OpenCage Geocode API.
- Generate an interactive map using the Folium library.
- Save the map as an HTML file for user access.

**2.3 User Characteristics**  
- Users with basic programming knowledge who need to track mobile locations.
- Individuals or organizations interested in geographical tracking of phone numbers.

**2.4 Constraints**  
- Requires an active internet connection to access APIs.
- API key limitations based on OpenCage Geocodeâ€™s free and paid plans.
- Accuracy dependent on publicly available geographical databases.

**2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies**  
- The phone number is valid and follows an international format.
- The OpenCage Geocode API provides accurate geolocation data.
- Users have Python installed along with required dependencies.

**3. Specific Requirements**  

**3.1 External Interface Requirements**  
- **User Interface:** The output is displayed in the command line and an HTML-based map.
- **Software Interfaces:** Uses Python libraries (`phonenumbers`, `folium`, `opencage.geocoder`).
- **Hardware Interfaces:** Runs on any system with Python support.
- **Communication Interfaces:** Internet connectivity is required for API calls.

**3.2 Functional Requirements**  
- The system shall accept a mobile number as input.
- The system shall validate the phone number format.
- The system shall retrieve the geographical location and service provider details.
- The system shall geocode the location to obtain latitude and longitude.
- The system shall generate and save a map with the marked location.

**3.3 Performance Requirements**  
- The system should provide results within a few seconds, depending on API response times.
- The map generation process should not exceed a reasonable execution time.

**3.4 Design Constraints**  
- Must use Python programming language.
- Relies on third-party APIs for geolocation data.

**3.5 Software System Attributes**  
- **Reliability:** API calls should handle errors and exceptions properly.
- **Security:** API keys must be securely stored.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be modular for easy updates and enhancements.
- **Usability:** Outputs should be clear and user-friendly.

**4. Appendices**  
- **Tools & Technologies:** Python, OpenCage Geocode API, Folium, `phonenumbers` library.
- **Future Enhancements:** 
  - Integration with a GUI for better user experience.
  - Addition of a database to log search history.
  - Real-time tracking capability.
